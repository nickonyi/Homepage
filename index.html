          Hello! I'm an aspiring software developer with a strong interest in
          building practical and user-friendly applications. I enjoy learning
          new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. I’m
          currently working on improving my skills in full-stack web
          development, particularly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN
          stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This portfolio showcases
          some of the projects I've worked on as I continue learning and growing
          in the tech field. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring how technology
          impacts everyday life, troubleshooting tech issues, and continuously
          pushing myself to become better at problem-solving. This is just the
          beginning — I’m excited to keep building and learning.
